#In this assignment, you are asked to use the R package kernlab to learn SVMs for 
#classifying the spam dataset that is included with the package. Consider the radial 
#basis function kernel (also known as Gaussian) with a width of 0.05. For the C 
#parameter, consider values 1, 10 and 100.
#(2p) Estimate the error for the three values of C. Use cross-validation with 2 folds. 
#Hint: Use the argument cross=2 when calling the function ksvm. Use the function cross() 
#to print out the error estimate. Use set.seed(1234567890).
#(2p) In the previous question, the error estimate may not be mono- tone with respect to 
#the value of C. Explain why this happens.

#NN
#In this assignment,you are asked to use the Rpackage neuralnet to train a NN to learn the trigonometric sine function. 
#To produce the learning data, sample 50 points uniformly at random in the interval [0, 10] and, then, 
#apply the sine function to each point.Your task is to estimate the mean squared error of a 
#NN with a single hidden layer of 10 units for the regression task described above. Use cross-validation 
#with 2 folds. For the training, initialize the weights of the NN to random values in the interval [âˆ’1, 1]. 
#Stop the training when the partial derivatives of the error function are below a threshold value of 0.001.
