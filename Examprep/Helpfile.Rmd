#Helpful info

**How to ensure that your model is not overfitting?**
Keep the design of the model simple. Try to reduce the noise in the model by considering fewer variables and parameters.
Cross-validation techniques such as K-folds cross validation help us keep overfitting under control.
Regularization techniques such as LASSO help in avoiding overfitting by penalizing certain parameters if they are likely to cause overfitting.
