An introductory course to machine learning at Link√∂ping University Sweden.

## Lab 1
### Assignment 1
- Splitting data into training and testing data
- Predicting models
- Generalized linear model
- Confusion matrices
- Missclassification rate
- K nearest neighbour

### Assignment 2
- Likelihood functions
- Bayesian functions

### Assignment 4
- Linear models
- Polynomial functions
- Minimal squared error
- Choosing a model by AIC using a stepwise algorithm. Both backwards and forwards.
- Lasso regression
- Ridge regression

## Lab 2
### Assignment 1
- Linnear discriminent analysis
- Logistic regression

### Assignment 2
- Decision trees (both gini and deviance)
- Pruning trees and selecting optimal number of leaves according to validation scores
- Naive bayesian model
- ROC and choosing the best model based on the AUC

### Assignment 3
- Regression trees
- Bootstrapping, both parametric and non-parametric
- Analysing histogram of residuals to choose whether parametric or non-parametric model is the optimal one for the data

### Assignment 4
- PCA analysis
- ICA analysis

## Lab 3
### Assignment 1
- Kernel functions, in this case a bayesian kernel
- Both the product of kernels and sum of kernels to compare

### Assignment 3
- Neural net with 10 hidden nodes for estimating a sinus-function
